The link leads to a virtual computer. In it you should find the scripts and data needed for EVE 225. Please open the night before class to make sure you have sufficient time to load all pakages for the first time. You can upload materials to the virtual computer, but this simulated space is only temporary. Please download everything you wish to keep.
